        <a>Hey there! I'm Aisa Blanka Szakal, a 19-year-old from Budapest, Hungary, who ventured to the Netherlands last September to kick off my studies at Fontys, Eindhoven. 
            I'm a huge travel enthusiast with a bunch of hobbies, but right now, soaking up as much from the world as possible is my top priority.
            Ever since attending a one-month course in the South of Italy, I've been captivated with Italian culture and language (and food) , so I'm dedicating my free time to learning Italian. On the side, I'm trying to study logic on an online course, studying JavaScript while I am coding my website and honing my skills in Adobe applications like Photoshop and Illustrator.
            When I am not in school, usually I am workjing at a café , as my part-time job.
            Staying active is a big part of who I am, so I make sure to squeeze in runs or gym sessions whenever I can. Cooking is another passion of mine—I love experimenting with different cuisines and cooking techniques.
            Finally I would mention my fascination with film and cinematography, since lately I have been really into that. I'm always eager to dive deeper into the world of movies and learn a little about that.
            That's me in a nutshell—always curious, always exploring, and always hungry for new experiences!
