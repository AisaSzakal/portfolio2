                For the first project, I took on the role of group leader, which was a new and challenging
                 experience for me. Initially, I found myself expressing my opinions too strongly, which led me 
                 to adjust my approach. Instead, I focused on facilitating communication within the group by creating
                  weekly and daily to-do lists on Notion, outlining workload maps, writing the content strategy, and addressing any questions or 
                  concerns about the project requirements.<br>
                  Writing the content strategy was a bigger assignment since I was not sure how to do that, therefor I did a few short research online,
                  where I searched for articles, which helped me to understand what should be included in a strategy like that, and I also asked for feedback about this topic,
                   to make sure it is well done and useful.<br>
                   In the end, I think I did a good job since the final feedback that I got was great.
                   I attached the content strategy and the final presentation (that I made for the group) below.<br>

My main responsibility was to oversee all aspects of the project and ensure that tasks were being 
completed efficiently. Rather than making unilateral decisions, I prioritized documentation (like the workload map)
  and collaboration, gathering and organizing the work contributed by my groupmates. <br>

In addition to conducting interviews, I assumed responsibility for preparing presentations for our Thursday lessons and the final presentation. 
This involved effectively communicating our progress to both our instructors and peers.<br><br>
At the end of the 1st group project, I also requested a meeting, where I asked my groupmates to share their feedback about each other 
so everyone could freely share their opinion, which can help to let go of negative feelings and push us to learn our mistakes. At the 
end of this meeting, I also offered my position as a group leader so that in the next group project someone else can try themselves out
 as a leader.<br><br>
 <span class="text-title">Project 2:</span><br><br>
 In the second project, we had to work for a client (Handpicked), that made a website for Breda.<br>
 Before we started brainstorming about how to reach our target audience (international students), we decided to 
 do a short research, on how other cities are connected to their target.<br>
 To of my groupmates chose a one-one city in The Netherlands, I personally wanted to choose something internationally,
 therefore I did a research about Antwerp.<br>
 After this research, I (/we) learned that most of these cities, have a very strong Instagram page, with hashtags, 
 and consistent content, and all of them focus on a chosen theme (for example tourists, or fun activities).<br>
 You can read the whole research attached below (my part is on page 8 and 9).<br>

 For this Group Project, I got the task of creating a presentation that my group could present to the client.<br>
After the first project we got feedback from a Teacher that our products and presentation were not consistent enough,
 she said that we had great ideas but it doesnâ€™t build up to one great outcome.<br>
I learned from it and therefore I tried to design a presentation that merged into our whole idea of 
making something young, fun, and fresh.<br>
If you are interested in the flow of building this presentation, then read the attached document below.<br>
