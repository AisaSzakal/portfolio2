            I recently attended every workshop conducted by one of my teachers, Amer, where we revisited the
             fundamentals of HTML and CSS and JavaScript. It's been a valuable experience as it allows me to deepen 
             my understanding independently.<br>
        During these lectures, I diligently take notes and complete all the assignments given to me.<br><br>

The primary focus of my first major assignment was to create a Pok√©mon figure using HTML & CSS, with an emphasis
 on ensuring its responsiveness across varying screen sizes. This task was instrumental in familiarizing us with 
 the principles of responsive web design.<br>

For the second major assignment, the objective was to delve into the workings of AI and utilize it within 
our project. We were tasked with crafting a "Jigglypuff" character using HTML & CSS, employing AI-generated 
responses to guide our design process. It was a captivating endeavor that allowed us to explore AI's interaction 
with different queries.<br>

The third task introduced us to JavaScript, where we were provided with an incomplete code fraught with errors. 
Our challenge was to identify and rectify these issues to finalize the game. This exercise honed our problem-solving 
skills within the realm of JavaScript programming.<br>
