                In the process of branding Nathalie's artworks, I've been utilizing Adobe apps extensively,
                 particularly Adobe Illustrator for designing logos and stylescapes. However, during my free time, 
                 I've also been experimenting with Photoshop and Premiere Pro. Decision-making in design, especially 
                 within a group setting with a client, can often prolong the process.<br><br>
For instance, when it came to selecting colors, Canva's color palettes proved to be incredibly helpful as they offer a wide
 range of options. Although I did explore different color schemes in an attempt to introduce fresh ideas to the client, more 
 often than not, we stuck with the preferences outlined by the client.<br><br>
My concept for the client centered around creating a stamp-like image featuring a blossoming pink flower, which was a specific
 request from the client. In the end my group usd my idea with the stamp but we used a logo that my groupmate made, so I merged the two into one.<br><br>
I had the idea of making flyers for the client as an offline media tool, therefore I designed two flyers. The client really liked these ideas in the end.<br>
