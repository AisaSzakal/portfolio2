                This semester, I've been deeply immersed in various research methodologies, interviews, 
                persona development, and more, across all of my projects.<br><br>
The significance of conducting thorough research first became evident during my initial group assignment. 
I conducted an in-depth interview with the client, focusing on specific questions to gain deeper insights. 
Subsequently, we designed a survey, which I tested with two individuals. Combining the results of my tests with those
 conducted by my group members, we were able to construct personas, providing us with a clearer understanding of our target audience.

 <span class="text-title">Later on</span>, Li Li assigned me and three of my classmates the task of researching student perceptions of merged courses 
(demand and course-based). I designed a survey and gathered responses from 40 students
 enrolled in both Semester 2 and 3 courses. Analyzing the data collected allowed me to draw 
 insightful conclusions about student sentiments towards the changes (for these insights and conclusions you shoul check out this link below).<br>

 <span class="text-title">Project 2:</span><br>
 For the second group project, we made several videos, and two of them were about the same story, clips, and sounds - just different editing.<br>
 Since we did not know which one we should choose, or what should we change about the mentioned videos, we decided to do some user testing 
 (I conducted it with one of my groupmates).<br>
 Throughout this test, we showcased both of the movies, and after that, I asked several questions, about the content, design, and clarity.<br>
 Since one of our intentions with these tests was to decide between the two videos, I also asked some simple questions that revealed which one they liked more.<br>
 My conclusion at the end of the tests (after testing with six people - 6 international students), was that our ideas were great but because of the similarities that
  the two videos had, everyone chose the option that we first showcased, therefore in the end we decided on merging the two clips.<br>

 <span class="text-title">Project 3:</span><br>
 For our final group project, we had to make an easter egg for the same website as before. After making a simple code with our idea,
 we decided to do user testing, to make sure that in the final product, everyone would go fluently, and on the other hand, we were curious what the user
 would think about specific subjects connected to our easter egg.<br>
My teammate and I tested four international students since they were our target group. I was responsible for noting everything, while my teammate prepared the necessary tools for the test, such as a timer and the laptop showcasing the product.
Each test was conducted individually to ensure honest feedback and lasted no longer than 16 minutes. During these tests, we aimed to determine how long it took users to find the right key to unlock the Easter egg. Knowing it wasn't an easy task, we also wanted to see if fun advertisements (like a TikTok video) would encourage users to visit the website and search for the Easter egg, therefore we also asked questions related to that. Additionally, we wanted to know if users would revisit the website periodically to search for the Easter egg or if their interest would wane. We also assessed their familiarity with similar Easter eggs, as limited knowledge might necessitate an easier-to-find Easter egg in the future.<br>
 The test results revealed that without hints or background knowledge, finding the key was challenging. However, users expressed curiosity when given hints and enjoyed the party vibe revealed by the Easter egg, along with the discount for a fun program in Breda. They mentioned they wouldn't check it frequently, but they might revisit the website if they were planning a trip to Breda or wanted to take advantage of the discount.
he main suggestion we received was to change the discount and design seasonally, as well as the hidden key, to keep it interesting. Overall, the feedback and recommendations were valuable. If we implement the Easter egg with some advertising, it could be a great success.

 <span class="text-title">Project X:</span><br>
 For my final project, I wanted to research Gen-Z and their perspectives on social life.
 Before I started to put together the survey that  I planned to send to 40 participants 
 (ultimately receiving 45 responses), I did a smaller
 library study, about this topic, at that point I realized this field is so much bigger than I initially thought.
 I also was well aware that from 4545 responses, I wouldn't be able to draw significant conclusions. 
 Therefore, my goal shifted to gaining a deeper understanding of my generation's thoughts and asking 
 unique questions not typically addressed in existing studies.
 Since I also wanted to make a podcast, I wanted to have topics that are captivating to talk about and to 
 listen to, therefore my survey questions had to be a bit unusual.
To ensure diverse responses, I sent the survey to a wide range of individuals, including people from different 
academic fields, countries, and walks of life, so not just to my peers at school.
 After I received enough data I started to analyze it in ways, that I thought would show some fascinating conclusions.
For instance, I analyzed the differences between male and female responses, compared answers across different 
age groups, and examined how phone usage frequency affected responses to specific questions.
This analysis provided valuable insights that I brought to the podcast recording. Additionally, I learned a 
lot about data analysis and survey design, realizing that I might would approach these tasks differently in the future. 
This project not only enhanced my understanding of Gen-Z's social life but also improved my research and analytical skills.
