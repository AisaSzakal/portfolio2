            <p><span class="text-title">Project 1:</span><br><br>
                Seeking feedback from teachers, peers, and our client was essential for both my
                 personal and group projects. It helped broaden perspectives and ensure decisions
                  weren't made in isolation. Gathering diverse viewpoints enriched the decision-making 
                  process and contributed to project success.<br><br>
                I regularly reached out to the client through online meetings and emails to gather 
                feedback, which was vital for our project's progress. The final feedback from the client
                 was especially positive, emphasizing the value of some of my ideas. This recognition
                  highlighted the importance of effective communication and collaboration in achieving 
                  success. <br><br>
                  <span class="text-title">As the Teacher's assistant</span> for Thursday lessons, I have the opportunity to gain 
                insights into file management and other administrative tasks. <br><br>
                <span class="text-title">For school:</span><br><br>
                Additionally, I was tasked with conducting research on the new study system in the
                 media design field. This assignment not only enhances my understanding of the subject 
                 but also provides valuable experience in managing multiple projects simultaneously.<br><br>
                 Overall, my interests are focusing on the designing part, since for me that is the most enjoyable part. But I also
                learned to find the nice parts of managing a group.<br><br>
                <span class="text-title">Personal Development:</span><br><br>
                 To develop myself in my free time I started an online course about Logics (https://www.coursera.org/learn/logic-introduction) 
                 for one of my Teacher's recommendation. I am also trying to develop my skills with the Adobe programs
                therefore whenever a project requires some designing I always try to take that part of the work
                 (you can see that in the other learning outcomes) <br>
                 It is might not really ICT related but I also in a process of learning a language (Italian). I feel like 
                 being able to communicate in more than 1 or 1 languages is an important skill to have, especially, when I wish to 
                 search for a job even in this field.<br><br>
                 <span class="text-title">For Fontys:</span><br><br>
                 Finally I took an opportunity of making a daily vlog kind of video for Fontys.
                 Making this video was a great way of learning how to face problems, like not to forget to take the videos throughout my day,
                 which was pretty hard I realized, since it is really not in my routine (you can read more about making this video in LO3).
                 However, for more information you can read in the document below.
