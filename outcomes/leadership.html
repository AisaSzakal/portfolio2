                Seeking feedback from teachers, peers, and our client was essential for both my
                 personal and group projects. It helped broaden perspectives and ensure decisions
                  weren't made in isolation. Gathering diverse viewpoints enriched the decision-making 
                  process and contributed to project success.<br><br>
                Overall, my interests are focusing on the designing part, and managing a group,
                 that is what I learned about the most.<br><br>
                I regularly reached out to the client through online meetings and emails to gather 
                feedback, which was vital for our project's progress. The final feedback from the client
                 was especially positive, emphasizing the value of some of my ideas. This recognition
                  highlighted the importance of effective communication and collaboration in achieving 
                  success. <br><br>
                As the teacher's assistant for Thursday lessons, I have the opportunity to gain 
                insights into file management and other administrative tasks. <br><br>
                Additionally, I was tasked with conducting research on the new study system in the
                 media design field. This assignment not only enhances my understanding of the subject 
                 but also provides valuable experience in managing multiple projects simultaneously.<br>
